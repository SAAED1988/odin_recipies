                                    <li>Beef & Sausage</li>
                                    <li>Mozzarella</li>
                                    <li>Egg</li>
                                    <li>Lasagna</li>
                                    <li>Onion</li>
                                    <li>Tomato Paste</li>
                                    <li>Parmesan</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong> For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</p>
                                <p><strong>Meat:</strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.</p>
                                <p><strong>Sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</p>
                                <p><strong>Spinach (variation):</strong> Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer.</p>

                            <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
                            <p>While homemade lasagna may have a few steps, each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Boil pasta:</strong> In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles <strong><em>per the recipe below.</em></strong></li>
                                        <li><strong>Prepare meat sauce:</strong> Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture:</strong> Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Layer & bake:</strong> Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
                                    </ol>
                            
                            <h2>Important: Let the Lasagna Rest</h2>
                            <p>Once removed from the oven, let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes (up to 45 minutes is fine, it will retain the heat well). This will allow it to thicken up a bit and help it keep its shape when cut. Resting is not required when reheating.</p>

                            <h2>How to Layer Lasagna</h2>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
                                        <li>Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
                                        <li>Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.</li>

                                    </ol>


                            <p>Once you have prepared the meat sauce and the cheese mixture, you’re ready to layer. This is the order of layers:</p>

                                      <ul>
                                        <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
                                        <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
                                        <li>sauce – noodles – cheese</li>
                                        <li>noodles – sauce (bake) – cheese</li>

                                        </ul>

                            <p>Serve with a big slice of homemade Garlic Bread and garnish with fresh basil or a couple of tablespoons of parsley. Finish the meal with a Caesar salad or Italian salad.</p>
