                    <h2>Ingredients You Need</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>secret to incredibly juicy burger patties</strong> is the addition of crushed crackers or panko breadcrumbs to hold in the natural fat and juices.</p>
                    <p>We recommend using crackers if you have them. Adding crushed crackers is an old-school method to add more flavor than plain breadcrumbs. Plus, it’s super handy for using up that package of crackers you’ve had sitting in the pantry for weeks.</p>

                    <p>Here is everything you need to make the <strong>best homemade burger patty recipe:</strong></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ground chuck</strong> – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs</strong> – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
                            <li><strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong> – Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Egg</strong> – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
                            <li><strong>Milk</strong> – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice.</li>

                        </ul>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>It’s helpful to save prep time and add lots of flavor to your patties by adding dried spices rather than fresh herbs to the hamburger mix. For instance, you can incorporate red pepper flakes for a spicier burger, a bit of cumin and chili powder for a Southwestern-inspired bite, or parsley and dill to create a Mediterranean taste.</p>

                    <h1>How To Make The Perfect Burger Every Time</h1>
                            <p>It seriously only takes mere minutes to make restaurant-quality homemade burgers from scratch. Prep your workspace and ingredients before getting started and you’ll be whipping out hot plates from your home kitchen (or backyard) in no time!</p>

                    <h2>Here’s how…</h2>
                            <p>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</p>
                            <p>Use your hands to combine until the mixture is thoroughly smooth.</p>

                    <img src="./imges-hamburger/image2preparation1.jpg" width="500" alt=""> <img src="./imges-hamburger/image3preparation2.jpg" width="500">

                            <p><strong>Next</strong>, press the meat down in the bowl into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:</p>
                            <p>Set out a baking sheet lined with wax paper or foil to hold the patties. One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly larger than the buns they’ll be served on since they’ll shrink slightly during in the cooking process.</p>
                            <p>Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press an indentation in the center of each patty, so they don’t puff up while cooking.</p>
                            <p>You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed.</p>
                            <p><strong>Then</strong>, preheat the <strong>grill</strong> or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F. I love using a cast-iron skillet for getting that drool-worthy caramelized sear on the burgers.</p>

                            <p><strong>For thick patties:</strong> Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.</p>
                            <p><strong>For thin patties:</strong> Cook on the <strong>griddle</strong> for 2 minutes per side.</p>
                            <p><strong>Ideally</strong>, you only want to flip your burgers once or twice during cooking.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Homemade cooked hamburger patties will keep well tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, or in an airtight container, in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>

                    <h2>How to Serve Homemade Hamburgers</h2>

                            <p>Stack the hot patties on hamburger buns, and dress up with your favorite hamburger toppings and condiments. One of my favorite condiments is <strong>Big Mac Sauce!</strong></p>
                            <p>You can try making your homemade burgers into a thick backyard barbecue classic with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and a bit of mayo and mustard.</p>
                            <p>Or my personal, gotta-have burger offers <strong>two thin patties</strong>, each covered by a slice of melted American cheese, and all loaded with tomato, pickles, crispy fried onions, and bbq sauce.</p>
                            <p>Other great toppings you can use are red onions, ketchup, and butter-grilled buns. Serve with either <strong>onion rings</strong> or <strong>sweet potato fries.</strong> </p>
                            <p>At least we can agree that the best homemade hamburgers are served with a heaping side of <strong>cajun fries, shoestring fries,</strong> or <strong>baked french fries!</strong></p>
